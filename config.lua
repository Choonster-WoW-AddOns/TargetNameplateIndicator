-- All of the textures listed above need to be prefixed with "Interface\\AddOns\\TargetNameplateIndicator\\Textures\\" like the default value below.
CONFIG.TEXTURE_PATH = "Interface\\AddOns\\TargetNameplateIndicator\\Textures\\Reticule"

-- You can add your own texture by placing a TGA image in the WoW\Interface\AddOns\TargetNameplateIndicator directory and changing the string after TEXTURE_PATH to match its name.
-- See the "filename" argument on the following page for details on the required texture file format:
-- http://www.wowpedia.org/API_Texture_SetTexture
--
-- GIMP (www.gimp.org) is a free image editing program that can easily convert almost any image format to TGA as well as let you create your own TGA images.
-- If you want your texture to be packaged with the AddOn, just leave a comment on Curse or WoWI with the image embedded or a direct link to download the image.
-- I can convert PNG and other formats to TGA if needed.
-- Make sure that you have ownership rights of any image that you contribute.



-- The height/width of the texture. Using a height:width ratio different to that of the texture file may result in distortion.
CONFIG.TEXTURE_HEIGHT = 50
CONFIG.TEXTURE_WIDTH = 50

-------
-- These four variables control how the texture is anchored to the nameplate.
-------

-- Used in texture:SetPoint(TEXTURE_POINT, nameplate, ANCHOR_POINT, OFFSET_X, OFFSET_Y)
-- See http://www.wowpedia.org/API_Region_SetPoint for explanation.
CONFIG.TEXTURE_POINT = "BOTTOM" -- The point of the texture that should be anchored to the nameplate.
CONFIG.ANCHOR_POINT  = "TOP"	   -- The point of the nameplate the texture should be anchored to.
CONFIG.OFFSET_X = 0 			   -- The x/y offset of the texture relative to the anchor point.
CONFIG.OFFSET_Y = 5
